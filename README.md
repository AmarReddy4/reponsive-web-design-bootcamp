# Responsive Web Design Bootcamp | Scrimba course files
Course files for the Responsive Web Design Bootcamp: https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive/

All files start at the same place as the first video of the project. It includes all images, plus a starting HTML and CSS files.
You will also notice that it includes a `normalize.css`. Scrimba includes this by default, behind the scenes. You'll want to leave this in each project file, and keep the link in the HTML file.
